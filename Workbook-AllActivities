Strengthen the connection

##########################

Activity 1
The sight guiding technique

On YouTube the Sighted Guide Technique video says: "Sighted guide technique allows both people on the sighted guide team to feel comfortable, safe, and actively walking together."

I have met several pairs during my research who talk about the connections and friendships they have built. They explain that sighted guiding has given them the opportunity to walk together, share experiences and develop a sense of one another.

Reflect on your connection

Together can you reflect on your connection? What are the small pleasures in sighted guiding, both as a guide and as a person being guided?

Activity 2
The Ramble Tag

The Ramble Tag is a lightweight harness, designed to be worn on a guide’s upper arm. It was created by Tom, who is blind, and Laura his neighbour who sometimes acts as his guide. They describe it as making the guiding experience more fluid and giving the blind person more independence and confidence. For more details visit the Ramble Tag website.

In the first envelope marked with a triangle shape, I have sent you an arm band so you can experiment with something a bit like the Ramble Tag. Take some time to explore it. Then try it out on a short walk with the guide wearing it on the preferred arm.

DIY - Ramble Tag 2.0

What would you add or how would you enhance the Ramble Tag to strengthen your connection?

Using materials you have received (post-it, straps, foam balls, fabrics, blue tack, and pens) and further materials you may find home, work together to create a personalised low-tech version of the Ramble Tag.

When you’re done, use your phone to take a picture of what you have created. Upload it using the Send your creation form below and add a description about how you have enhanced the Ramble Tag.

Activity 3
A sound presence

What if the Ramble Tag could also produce a sound while you walked together?

Probe challenge

We would like you to try the following to experiment with this idea. For this activity, use the armband we have sent you in the envelope marked with a circle along with the smartphone you are using to view this page.

Set up the armband and your phone:
1. Put the band on the top of guide's upper arm. The arm you usually use to guide your companion.
2. Place your phone on the guide's arm and over the armband, so that it's about halfway up the band. Ensure the phone speaker is facing towards the halfway up.
3. Roll up the bottom of the armband over the phone, so that it holds the phone snuggly.
4. Now take a short walk outside using your usual sighted guide formation. While you walk, press the media play button on this page (it should play a rhythmic sound). The sound will be played back repeatedly until you stop it. Once you have a good sense of walking together, with the accompanying sound, end the walk at any time.

SOUND MEDIA PLAYER: WHICH IS A SUITABLE SOUND???

What and how has the audio feedback strengthened your connection while walking?

Activity 4
What does a sound tell you about your companion?
In the last activity of this section, I would like you to further explore how sound can be used to enhance your connection. Move to a comfortable place at home where you usually do not need to use the sighted guide technique to move around. As in the previous activity, attach the arm band with the smartphone to the upper arm of the guide.
Begin the activity in close proximity to one another. Start by choosing one of the three sounds to playback.

SOUND MEDIA PLAYER 01: WHICH IS A SUITABLE SOUND???
SOUND MEDIA PLAYER 02: WHICH IS A SUITABLE SOUND???
SOUND MEDIA PLAYER 03: WHICH IS A SUITABLE SOUND???

Before starting the task, remind to play back a sound of your choice. You can choice one of three below.
While the sound is playing simulate a daily routine where one of you has to move apart from the other. For example, opening a window or serving a drink.
Try the task again, but change roles and the sound you have chosen.
Reflect on your activity
What did the audio feedback tell you about your companion? Reflect on cases, when one of you was doing the task and vice-versa and on the different audio sounds.

The role AI might play

##########################

Activity 1

Experience 2 small applications
Materials set up
One person has to hold the smartphone you are using for this workbook in front of themselves
the other person has to wear the tangible tag tied to a strap on their arm. You can find the tangible tag in the envelope marked by a square. A tag is a binary drawing composed of geometric shapes. You can sense it using the large tactile version provided in the materials.
The following two pages contain two slightly different applications to detect the tag one person is wearing using the smartphone's camera the other person is holding. When the tag is detected an audible feedback is played back. When you start, change your position in relation to your companion (e.g., move from left to right, or come closer) and experience how the audible feedback changes in relation to one another position and orientation. A brief task description is provided at the top of each page. The Strat application button will lead you to the first application.

How far are you?
During my studies I have met some pair who told me that while walking together may also happen they physically disengage for some reason (e.g., an unexpected event happening in the surrounding) and both companions may feel disoriented.
Has that ever happened to you? How far do you move?
A new wearable AI sensor can detect these moments of physical disengagement. Which kind of information would you be interested in receiving?

One person has to hold the smartphone in front of themselves, the other person has to wear the tangible tag on the arm. Ensure the tag is facing the phone's front camera.
Experience 2 small applications
The following two pages contain two slightly different applications to detect the tag you are wearing. When the tag is detected an audible feedback is played back. A brief task description is provided at the top of each page.

--------------------

Exploring Direction
This application uses the front camera of your smartphone to capture the scene in front of you and detect a tag worn by the other person. When the tag is detected the application plays back a sound. The audible feedback has a soft sound when in the middle of the screen and  changes in rate (it accelerates) when it is close to the left or right camera's edges.

--------------------

Exploring Distance
Similarly to the previous application, this one detects the tag using the  smartphone’s front camera. When the tag is detected the application plays back a sound. This time the audible feedback changes in volume. It get louder as it moves closer to the camera.

--------------------

Activity 1
Reflect on these applications in relation to your guiding experience
During my studies I have met some pair who told me that while walking together may also happen they physically disengage for some reason (e.g., an unexpected event happening in the surrounding) and both companions may feel disoriented. Has that ever happened to you? How far do you move? How do you move in relation to your companion?

A new wearable AI sensor can detect these moments when you are not in physical contact during a walk. Which kind of information would you be interested in receiving?  What would a sound indicate?  How would it support your communication?


--------------------

Activity 2
How would you teach a machine to learn your body language?
I have realised travel companions create their own language. For instance, a sighted guide (Sara) usually says "Go skinny" and moves her arm towards her back to indicate to her blind companion to move behind her, for instance because the street ahead is getting narrow.
You are a team who has the opportunity to label actions related to sighted guiding for an AI technology which will be developed to recognise body movements in sighted guiding. What are relevant actions of your own body language you want to teach?
Have a walk outside using your usual sighted guiding formation.
1. Pause the walk every time one of you does a body movement you think an AI tech should recognise.
2. Think aloud and discuss together: What is this movement? Why did you choice it?
3. Use one, 2 or few words to label the body movement: What does it mean for you?

Activity 3
Silence is also communication
Current voice synthesisers (e.g., Siri) recognise and response to your voice, but they ignore silence. In early research I found silence was used in the sighted guiding practice as a relevant sign to shift the attention towards something more challenging happening around (e.g., while getting through a narrow gap or some passers-by coming up). If a pause in the ongoing conversation while walking together can be detected by an intelligent system an audible feedback could be used to support challenging situations you experience.
Discuss and reflect
While walking together what is a challenge situation you have experience? What would a sound indicate? How would it support your communication?
