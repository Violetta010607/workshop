Hello! I am Beatrice. The following 3 paragraphs are an Introduction to the workshop you have agreed to participate in. Please, take the time to read the text carefully.

In the early stages of my PhD research, before we were all forced to stay at home, I conducted a study with blind people and their guides. Through this study, I discovered that strong connections can develop in sighted guide partnerships. Over time, I have seen how pairs develop a sense of each other’s movements that helps them move fluidly together. It’s clear that sighted guide partnerships work very well and rely on people’s shared and creative use of skills. 

In this follow-up research, I’m interested in the ways technology could be used to strengthen this partnership. Unlike other technological solutions that prioritise independence, I’m much more curious about how technology can support what already works so well, in this case, the way blind people and their guides move together. 

In each of the following activities, I am inviting pairs to think about the ways they use their bodies together and communicate with one another in subtle and often creative ways. I also introduce some very simple technologies to help stimulate ideas for the role technology might play. What is really important in this workbook is that the activities are understood as starting points for strengthening people’s partnerships and not proposals for final solutions. I want to create a language and set of tools that we can use to think together.

Workbook: Strengthening connections

#########################

The first section of this workbook comprises 4 activities. These activities will explore the physical connection and relationship you have as sighted guiding companions. 

You can move forwards and backwards through the activities by pressing the "next" and "back" buttons at the end of each activity page. Try your best to step through the activities in the order they are presented.

Strengthen the connection

##########################

Activity 1
The sight guiding technique

On YouTube the Sighted Guide Technique video says: "Sighted guide technique allows both people on the sighted guide team to feel comfortable, safe, and actively walking together."

I have met several pairs during my research who talk about the connections and friendships they have built. They explain that sighted guiding has given them the opportunity to walk together, share experiences and develop a sense of one another.

Reflect on your connection

Together can you reflect on your connection? What are the small pleasures in sighted guiding, both as a guide and as a person being guided?

Audio record your answer and send your recording.

Activity 2
The Ramble Tag

The Ramble Tag is a lightweight harness, designed to be worn on a guide’s upper arm. It was created by Tom, who is blind, and Laura his neighbour who sometimes acts as his guide. They describe it as making the guiding experience more fluid and giving the blind person more independence and confidence. For more details visit the Ramble Tag website.

In the first envelope marked with a triangle shape, I have sent you an arm band so you can experiment with something a bit like the Ramble Tag. Take some time to explore it. Then try it out on a short walk with the guide wearing it on the preferred arm.

DIY - Ramble Tag 2.0

What would you add or how would you enhance the Ramble Tag to strengthen your connection?

Using materials you have received (post-it, straps, foam balls, fabrics, blue tack, and pens) and further materials you may find home, work together to create a personalised low-tech version of the Ramble Tag.

When you’re done, use your phone to take a picture of what you have created. Upload it using the Send your creation form below and add a description about how you have enhanced the Ramble Tag.

--------------------------

Activity 3
A sound presence

What if the Ramble Tag could also produce a sound while you walked together?

Probe challenge

We would like you to try the following to experiment with this idea. For this activity, use the armband we have sent you in the envelope marked with a circle along with the smartphone you are using to view this page.

Set up the armband and your phone:
1. Put the band on the top of guide's upper arm. The arm you usually use to guide your companion.
2. Place your phone on the guide's arm and over the armband, so that it's about halfway up the band. Ensure the phone speaker is facing towards the halfway up.
3. Roll up the bottom of the armband over the phone, so that it holds the phone snuggly.
4. Now take a short walk outside using your usual sighted guide formation. While you walk, press the media play button on this page (it should play a rhythmic sound). The sound will be played back repeatedly until you stop it. Once you have a good sense of walking together, with the accompanying sound, end the walk at any time.

SOUND MEDIA PLAYER: WHICH IS A SUITABLE SOUND???

What and how has the audio feedback strengthened your connection while walking?

Audio record your answer and send your recording.

--------------------------

Activity 4
What does a sound tell you about your companion?
In the last activity of this section, I would like you to further explore how sound can be used to enhance your connection. Move to a comfortable place at home where you usually do not need to use the sighted guide technique to move around. As in the previous activity, attach the arm band with the smartphone to the upper arm of the guide.
Begin the activity in close proximity to one another. Start by choosing one of the three sounds to playback.

SOUND MEDIA PLAYER 01: WHICH IS A SUITABLE SOUND???
SOUND MEDIA PLAYER 02: WHICH IS A SUITABLE SOUND???
SOUND MEDIA PLAYER 03: WHICH IS A SUITABLE SOUND???

Before starting the task, remind to play back a sound of your choice. You can choice one of three above.

While the sound is playing simulate a daily routine where one of you has to move apart from the other. For example, opening a window or serving a drink.
Try the task again, but change roles and the sound you have chosen.
Reflect on your activity
What did the audio feedback tell you about your companion? Reflect on cases, when one of you was doing the task and vice-versa and on the different audio sounds.
Audio record your answer and send your recording.

Workbook: The role technology might play

#########################

In the second section of this workbook I will present 4 activities and proposals to work on. Together, we will explore some basic ingredients of AI technology to begin thinking about the possible roles AI could play to enhance your partnership.

As in the previous section, you can access each activity pressing the "next" and "back" buttons at the end of each activity page.  You’re welcome to read all the activities first or to read them as you go.

The role technology might play

##########################

Activity 1

Sensing a wearable tag

In this activity, I’d like you to experiment with two slightly different ways of sensing a wearable tag. The tag I’ve sent to you is composed of black and white geometric shapes and designed to be relatively easy to detect using a camera. You can find this in the envelope marked with a square. Use the large tactile version of the tag, provided in the materials, to get a sense of its shape.
To prepare for the activity, you’ll need to arrange yourselves in the following way:
One of you (Person A) should strap the tangible tag to your arm making sure it’s clearly visible.
The other person (Person B) should hold the smartphone you are using to participate in the activities. You will be using the front-facing camera on the phone (the camera on the side of the screen) so hold it so the camera can be pointed towards your partner.

--------------------

Exploring left-to-right movement

The first thing you’ll experiment with is sensing the left-to-right movement of the person wearing the tag.
Person B should hold the smartphone so the camera is pointing towards Person A. Once this is done, centre the tag on the screen as best you can. When the tag is detected the phone will play a sound. The audible feedback has a soft sound when in the middle of the screen and  changes in rate (or pitch) when the tag moves to the left or right of the camera’s field of view. You should try out different movements together to get sense of how the system works. For example, the person wearing the tag (Person B) should move, then Person A might try moving the camera. Think about how you relate to one another and consider whether anything adds to sense you have of one another.


--------------------

Exploring Distance
As with the previous experiment, you’ll be detecting the tag using the  smartphone’s front camera. When the tag is detected the phone plays back a sound. This time the audible feedback represents the tag’s distance from the phone. The sound will change in volume. It will get louder as the tag is moved closer to the camera.
As with before, experiment with this. Try moving closer and further away from each other. Can you imagine this giving you a greater sense of the person you’re with? How does this differ to the left-to-right experiment? Could they work together?

--------------------

Activity 1
Reflect on these experiments in relation to your guiding experience
How might ways of sensing distance and movement compliment the ways you interact with one another?
During my earlier research, I met some pairs who told me that while walking together they sometime physically disengage for some reason (e.g., an unexpected event happening in the surroundings). Here the sight impaired person can feel disoriented. Has that ever happened to you? Do you move or stand still? How do you move in relation to your companion?
Sensors like the ones we’ve experimented with can detect moments when you are not in physical contact, like in the situation we’ve just discussed. What kinds of information would you be interested in receiving? What would a sound indicate? How would it support your communication?

--------------------

Activity 2
How would you teach a machine to learn your body language?
I have realised travel companions create their own language. For instance, one sighted guide I’ve worked with often says "Go skinny" and bends her arm back to indicate to her blind companion to move behind her, for instance because the street ahead has narrowed.

Imagine you are a team who has been given the opportunity to label actions related to sighted guiding for new assistive technology. The technology will recognise body movements in sighted guiding. What kinds of actions or body movements would you want to teach?
Have a walk outside using your usual sighted guiding formation.
1. Pause the walk every time one of you makes a body movement you think an assistive technology should recognise.
2. Use one to three words to label the body movements.
3. Think aloud and discuss the movement. Why did you chose it? How does it help you work together? How might the recognition of it by an assistive technology help you, even if in a small way?

Send your data

Activity 3
Silence is also communication.
Current voice synthesisers (e.g., Siri) recognise and respond to your voice, but they ignore silence. In early research, I found silence was used in the sighted guiding partnership as a sign to shift the attention towards something more challenging happening in the surroundings. For example, while navigating a narrow gap or passing some approaching passers-by.

Using provided materials and other materials you may have home (e.g., pens, strings, cutlery, pasta, nuts) craft and illustrate on the table a familiar short journey, or situation where you have noticed a pause in the conversation plays an important role in your own partnership. How does silence support you both? Use a post-it or a piece of paper to answer this question and stick-it close to your creation.
Take a picture of your initial creation.

If that pause in the conversation you have identified in the previous situation could be detected by a new assistive technology how might it support you both? Could it give you additional information about your surroundings and how they are changing? Also, what kind of feedback could accompany the silence? An unobtrusive sound, some sort of tactile feedback? Reflect together on these questions and using materials you have available improve your creation to express your idea.
Take a picture of your final creation.

Use the send my creation form to upload both pictures. If you feel you want to further explain your creation use the text area in the form.

-------------------

Activity 4
Better together than apart
A famous phylosopher said: “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts”.
Reflect on your experiences working together. Think about contexts, situations, or actions during sighted guiding where you’ve combined your skills to achieve something together. This might be something obvious like jointly sensing some commotion in your surroundings or something more subtle like the pause in the conversation you both take, as discussed in the previous activity. In turn, each describe a meaningful situation where you have added to your combined strengths as a pair. Consider, in particular, the give and take of the partnership.

Reflect on these situations you’ve shared. 

Can you think of a role for technology in strengthening what you achieve as partners in these situations? This will be difficult, I know, so if you find it hard try completing or replacing the placeholder words in the following statements:

What if an assistive technology could … What if an assistive technology could recognise us [placeholder] This would enable us to … This would enable us to be more [placeholder] together
In the Send your enhanced situations form, describe the 2 situations (adding details about the two-way nature of the interactions). Also send any completed sentences you were able to put together. Send your enhanced situations form
